# 🎖️ Algorithms

Welcome to my **Algorithms Solutions Repository**! This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems, categorized by programming language and platform.

## 📁 Repository Organization

This repository is structured as follows:

```
|-- Language 
  |-- Platform 
    |-- Difficulty 
      |-- Problem Files
```
   
Each problem solution is organized by **language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.) and then by the **platform** where the problem was solved. The platforms I regularly solve problems on include:

- [Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/)
- [Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/)
- [SWEA](https://swexpertacademy.com/main/main.do)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## 🏷️ Platforms

- **Baekjoon** 📚: Competitive programming platform popular in Korea.
- **Programmers** 💼: Platform focusing on real-world coding tests.
- **SWEA** 🧩: Samsung's Expert Academy.
- **LeetCode** 🌍: Global coding interview practice.
